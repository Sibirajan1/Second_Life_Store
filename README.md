The Second Life Store is a full-stack web application developed to promote sustainable consumption by enabling users to buy, sell, and recycle pre-owned products. The platform is built using React.js for the front-end, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface with modular and reusable components. The application provides a seamless shopping experience through key modules such as Home, Orders, Cart, and Sell Product, each designed to manage different aspects of user interaction and e-commerce functionality.
The system allows users to browse available products, view detailed descriptions, add items to their cart, and place orders securely. In addition, registered users can sell their used products by providing details and uploading images, thereby extending the product lifecycle and reducing waste. The application leverages React Context API for global state management and React Router for efficient navigation between pages without reloading. User authentication and product management ensure personalized and secure transactions.
The primary objective of this project is to create an eco-friendly online marketplace that not only encourages the reuse of goods but also raises environmental awareness through technology. The project demonstrates effective use of modern web development concepts, including component reusability, state management, hooks, and responsive design. Overall, the Second Life Store serves as a scalable and user-friendly solution that bridges sustainability with digital commerce
